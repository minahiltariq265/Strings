# Strings
A collection of python solutions for strings problems.
1. Babbage
   # This Python program identifies:
   a. The number of smallest natural numbers to find.
   b. The sequence of digits the square should end with.
2. ISBN
   # This program validates whether a given string is a valid ISBN-10 number based on the rules of the ISBN.
   a. This script will continuously accept ISBN-10 strings until the user types 'stop'.
   b. The program validates each input and outputs either OK (valid) or WRONG (invalid).
3. Mathemagical
   # This Python program takes an integer input, suppresses one digit at a time from the number, calculates the resulting numbers, and computes their total sum. It also provides a formatted output displaying each suppressed number, the summation, and the total.
4. Reading Pitch
   # Deciphers a given text based on a starting position and a step size. The algorithm repeatedly selects characters from the text in a cyclic manner and outputs the final rearranged text.
5. Reciprocation
   # Validates three sequences based on specific rules. It ensures that the digits at corresponding positions in the sequences satisfy a certain condition, otherwise replacing the invalid values with "X". The program works by comparing digits at the same position across all three sequences and checking if the count of each digit matches in the other two sequences.
6. Word evolution
   # Simulates a letter evolution process, transforming each letter in a word toward a target letter using cyclic shifts within the alphabet. For each character in the word, the function prints the steps needed to evolve it to the target letter, displaying both upper and lower case transitions.
